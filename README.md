# Spring Boot Web Starting Project

This is spring-boot-web-starting-project.

This project is a standalone Spring Boot Web standalone app. All you need is one war file.

## Requirements
This project is tested with:
* Java 21
* Maven 3.9.5

## IDE Notes
If you are working with IntelliJ IDEA like me, make sure you set file 
encoding for properties files to UTF-8. I would recommend to always work in UTF-8 encoding.
